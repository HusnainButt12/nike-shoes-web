          The products we offer in clearance sale are from old lots and are the
          leftover pairs at our warehouse from different inventories. These
          pairs may or may not be little damaged (But in usable state). As
          different materials are used in the products so the life or durability
          of those may be effected due to multiple reasons such as Moisture,
          Oxygenization & Shelf Life Expiration of product.
